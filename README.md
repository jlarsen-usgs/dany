# pyhydro
workshop for developing grid independent flow accumulation algorithms


## todos:

   - MF6 package data block
   - MF6 package data
   - MF2005 segment data
   - methods for incorporating linework
   - methods for incorporation GIS data in SFR parameterization (ex. NHDPlus/NHGF data)
   - Additional PRMS features derived from DEM (hru_area, slope, aspect, etc...)

## completed:
First pass completion on:
   - flow directions
   - flow accumulation
   - watershed delineation
   - subbasin delineation
   - Stream segment ordering
   - MF2005 reach data
   - MF6 connection data
   - PRMS many to one cascades
   - PRMS many to many cascades
   - DEM conditioning (sink and pit detection and fill methods)
